        <p>Hi. Welcome to my website, Lightbook.</p>

        <p>Growing up as a 'weird' and 'nerdy' girl, I didn't have a lot of friends. 
          I didnt't spend nights hanging out, nor I enjoyed conversations in coffee shops like other people did. 
          You need friends for that.</p>

          <p>But it's okay, I spent my nights reading. Diving deep into stories, being obsessed with all these different characters, navigating
            their own challenges in their own circumstances, handling problems in their own way. For me, it was the place where my imagination could freely thrive as I explored countless new worlds.
            Better then any night club I could have ever gone to. But, I missed having at least one true friend to share my passions with...
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, when I started university, I got accepted for who I am and made friends with a group of book lovers — the best people I could have met! We shared passion for books, cute things, and cozy atmosphere.
            We go to the library together, shop for cute items, and discuss convoluted journeys of unique characters we read about.
            Sometimes, we even enjoy coffee shop conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Books and cozy atmospheres are everything to me, and I want everyone to experience late-night reads in cozy room enriched with cute dimmed night lights.
            For those who are not familiar yet, I hope my story inspires your curiosity to discover this atmosphere for yourself.
            That's why I started Lightbook, a place where you can get the best and cutest items to enhance your reading experience.

            This is probably not the ordinary brand story you expected to read, but I felt the need to express myself here, like a writer, 
            letting you get a glimpse into my soul, revealing the personal journey and heartfelt inspiration behind Lightbook.
            
       
          </p>

        <p>Thank you for taking time to read my story.</p>

// The Nue Cup™ was designed from long nights and hard days filled with neck and shoulder pain. I found myself incredibly frequent to cupping therapy appointments, massages and even acupuncture to help cure my build up of stress, knots, and over all pain and discomfort. I quickly realized this was not sustainable and looked to begin developing a new and improved solution. Cupping was the form of therapy that helped my shoulder and neck tension the most so I worked tirelessly to develop something that I could use myself, while sitting at my desk with ease, after 4 years of development I am extremely proud to present to you....
