        In our tight-knit group of four, our profound connection centered around a shared passion for gaming. From the early consoles of our childhood to the intricate worlds of adulthood, our bond deepened through countless nights spent in front of screens, navigating virtual landscapes together. Victories and defeats wove into the fabric of our connection, creating enduring memories.

        Facing the challenges of growing up, gaming became more than an escape – it became a vessel for self-discovery. Each of us brought a unique flair to the gaming table – the strategist, the creative soul, the quick reflexes, and the meticulous attention to detail.

// The Nue Cup™ was designed from long nights and hard days filled with neck and shoulder pain. I found myself incredibly frequent to cupping therapy appointments, massages and even acupuncture to help cure my build up of stress, knots, and over all pain and discomfort. I quickly realized this was not sustainable and looked to begin developing a new and improved solution. Cupping was the form of therapy that helped my shoulder and neck tension the most so I worked tirelessly to develop something that I could use myself, while sitting at my desk with ease, after 4 years of development I am extremely proud to present to you....
